// A linear search is a simple method for finding an element in a list or array. It checks each element one by one, starting from the first element and moving sequentially, until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

// How Linear Search Works:
// Start at the first element of the list.
// Compare the current element with the target value.
// If they match, return the position of the element.
// If they don’t match, move to the next element.
// Repeat steps 2-4 until you find the target or reach the end of the list.
// If the target is not found, indicate that it does not exist in the list.

// Key Points:
// Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) where n is the size of the list, because it may need to check every element.
// Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space is required.
// Use Case: Useful for small or unsorted datasets. For larger datasets, other algorithms like binary search are more efficient if the data is sorted.
