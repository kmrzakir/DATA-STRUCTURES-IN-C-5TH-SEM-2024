Printing Jobs: In a printer queue, print jobs are managed in a FIFO order.
Real-Time Systems: Queues are used in systems requiring real-time processing, such as telecommunications.

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
In graph and tree traversal algorithms, BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.

Data Handling
Buffers: Used in buffering data streams, such as video streaming, to handle data input/output.

Operating Systems
Process Scheduling: In operating systems, queues are used for managing processes in the CPU. For example, the ready queue holds all processes waiting to be executed by the CPU.

Network Applications
Packet Queuing: Data packets in routers are queued before being transmitted over the network.

Task Scheduling
Queues are used in task scheduling in software systems to execute tasks in sequence.
