1.Implementing Other Data Structures
Stacks and queues can be implemented using linked lists.
Graphs: Adjacency lists in graph representations use linked lists.
Sparse Matrices: Linked lists efficiently store sparse matrices.

2.Dynamic Memory Allocation
Linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation as their size is not fixed, unlike arrays.

3.Music and Media Players
Linked lists are used in playlists to manage songs. You can play the next or previous track using the next and previous references.

4. Networking
In networking, linked lists manage packets or connections dynamically.

5. Operating Systems
Process Scheduling: Doubly linked lists are used to manage processes in the operating system.

6. Mostly use din those cases where insertion and deletion of elemnets sohuld be faster.
